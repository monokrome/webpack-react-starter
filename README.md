React Webpack Starter
=====================


This is a project providing a minimal boilerplate for getting started with
server-side rendering as well as static rendering for React projects.

To create a new React application with it, you can follow the following steps:

  > git clone https://github.com/monokrome/webpack-react-starter myproject
  > cd myproject
  > npm install

To run a development (not production-ready yet) server for server-side
rendering:

  > npm start

You can also run without server-side rendering using:

  > npm run develop

You can reformat, lint, and type-check your code all at once with:

  > npm run lint
